                        Through a bachelorâ€™s degree at Vanderbilt, I honed concise and clear writing skills and gained insight on the type of writing academic institutions desire.
                        While this writing style is helpful for applications, grant writing, and more, it is often undesirable outside of the world of academia.<br/><br/>
                        As an art curator, I developed a more community oriented writing style; I have helped countless folks write bios and artist statements to portray more personal messages directed towards community connection.<br /><br />
